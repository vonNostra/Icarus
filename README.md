Platform Independent Flight Control Software utilizing primarily Inertial Measurement

Goal: To create a platform independent software package that allows positional flight plans, and GPS free movement through the use of an Extended Kalman Filter to analyze data. While attempting this goal, an abstraction layer will be implemented that allows the use of any sensors supported, on any microcontroller platform, to allow the main flight code to be mostly static, with a few notable exceptions. across all platforms. This project is licensed under the GNU General Public License V2, with the option to apply v3 removed.
